## About this project
A current portfolio showcasing my skills and talent to employers who are looking to fill part-time and full-time position.

The following shows two VSC windows for comparison. Left side (after) shows how repeating CSS selectors have been consolidated and the right side (before) shows the original code having been repeated. Both achieves the same results except the consolidated CSS is grouped together looking more simpler, taking up less line space and easy to manage:
